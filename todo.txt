handle websites which require a cookie to display images (ex : vimm)
-> or add a scraper for each category to add images when they are missing

publish to aur (-git and -bin versions)

think about how to handle pagination

handle websites that have 'background-image' in style to extract the image's url (in scrapePlainHtml.go)

select criterias to sort sources (quality, speed, captchas, premium hosts etc)

create post-processors for websites which have multiple categories. the post processor would take all the search results 
and only return the ones relevent to the selected categories
