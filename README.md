This tool brings a graphical interface to search for files through multiple websites. Similarily to what [Jackett](https://github.com/Jackett/Jackett) does, but for DDL (direct download).

## Goals

- [ ] List files together with their informations (size, thumbnail preview, length (pages/duration etc), publication date, etc)

- [ ] Sort files in the list

- [ ] Add categories/subcategories for each website and only search for files in appropriate categories/subcategories

- [ ] Don't show the same file multiple times if it is found on multiple sources (group by)

- [ ] Create a score system to rank sources (in case of multiple sources for the same file) (based on dl speed, accuracy etc.)

- [ ] Support multiple languages

- [ ] Support websites which require authentication to search (usually forums)

- [ ] Allow the user to create custom lists of websites for custom categories (only search on those websites if the custom category is selected)

### Categories

ebooks, audio books, newspapers/magazines, courses, movies, tv shows, anime, music, computer software, android apks, console games, pc games, pictures
