This tool brings a graphical interface to search for files through multiple websites. Similarily to what [Jackett](https://github.com/Jackett/Jackett) does, but for DDL (direct download).

## Goals

- [ ] List files together with their informations (size, thumbnail preview, length (pages/duration etc) etc)

- [ ] Sort files in the list

- [ ] Add categories for each website and only search for files in appropriate categories

- [ ] Don't show the same file multiple times if it is found on multiple sources (group by)
