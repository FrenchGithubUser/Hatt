This tool allows to search for files through multiple websites, with an intuitive user interface. Similarily to what [Jackett](https://github.com/Jackett/Jackett) does, but for DDL (direct download).

## Not Goals (to this day)

- All-in-one tool to download/stream media and display it nicely at the same time. Many softwares already do that very well ([Kodi](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc) for movies/TV shows, [Pegasus-fe](https://github.com/mmatyas/pegasus-frontend) for games and programs, just to name a few)

- Easy "download" option. Some programs already allow to download files very well ([JDownloader](https://jdownloader.org/), [Youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl), [Lux](https://github.com/iawia002/lux), just to name a few). There might be an implementation of such a feature by adding those programs as dependencies to Hatt later.
